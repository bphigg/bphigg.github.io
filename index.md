# Welcome to my ST558 (601) FALL '23 Blog!  
*This site and account will be used in support of various R programming and R script development projects*

### Some things I hope to explore on this site:
* sharing code
* sharing thoughts on coding and markdown language
   + including posting links that help solve coding and markdown language problems
* offering any hard won insights into R or .Rmd scripting ~~(if any are won)~~
