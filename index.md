# Welcome to my Data Analysis Programming Blog!  
*This site and account will be used in support of various R and Python programming as well as R and Python script development projects*

My name is **brian higginbotham** and I enjoy exploring, interpreting, and visualizing data. I currently live in Asheville, NC with my wife, two children, and a~~n annoying~~ cat.

### Some things I hope to explore on this site:
* sharing code
* sharing thoughts on coding and markdown language
   + including posting links that help solve coding and markdown language problems
* offering any hard won insights into R and Python scripting
