This notebook explores the **MLlib** library in *pySpark*. It focuses on importing data into a spark session and utilizing numerous *pySpark* features (```SQLTransformer```, ```Binarizer```, ```VectorAssembler```, ```VectorIndexer```, ```StringIndexer```) to transform the data into a format for model fitting. ```CrossValidator()```, ```Pipeline()```, ```ParamGridBuilder()``` functions are then used to iterate through selected model parameters with the optimal parameters automatically fitted to the model object. The "goal" of this notebook is to compare three separate models (**Regularized Linear Regression**, **Random Forest**, **Gradient Boosting**) and evaluate their predictive accuracy using '*mean absolute error*.'

Descriptions of the model types are given in the notebook.
