# Project 3

For this project we want to build and compare model results to predict if an individual has diabetes or not. We will look at how these predictions change with respect to the education level of the patient. Do do this, we will create a Rmd file that will produce EDA and training models and evaluate the models' performance on test data. We will then automate this file to run for each education level and select the best performance model. The diabetes data we will utilize is the [Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/) available through Kaggle.

I thought the data set for this project was somewhat challenging. There were over 20 variables within the dataset and most related to physiological and medical indicators. I believe this led to a lot of correlation between the variables - bad health indicators in one variable being related to bad health indicators in other variables. We know that highly correlated predictors are generally not good for modeling and while building and testing models I found that the Accuracy rating on the test set was not much better than the "dumb" method of just predicting that everyone does not have diabetes. I concluded that there was just not enough non-correlated data available for the models to produce meaningful results.
