# Project 3

For this project we want to build and compare model results to predict if an individual has diabetes or not. We will look at how these predictions change with respect to the education level of the patient. Do do this, we will create a Rmd file that will produce EDA and training models and evaluate the models' performance on test data. We will then automate this file to run for each education level and select the best performance model. The diabetes data we will utilize is the [Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/) available through Kaggle.

I thought the data set for this project was somewhat challenging. The dataset 

In this analysis, we explore a dataset focusing on diabetes, utilizing R  for our examination. The dataset contains essential variables that offer insights into various aspects related to diabetes. The key variables we will be working with include demographic information, physiological measurements, and medical indicators. It is important to note that the dataset contains information from individuals with and without diabetes, making it a valuable resource for understanding the factors associated with the condition

Our primary goal is to conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis to gain insights into the relationships between various variables and the presence or absence of diabetes. Through statistical summaries, visualizations, and correlation analyses, we aim to uncover patterns, identify potential predictors, and understand the distribution of key features within the dataset, mainly BMI, General Health, Age and Income.

Furthermore, we will develop predictive models to explore the ability of the selected variables to accurately predict diabetes outcomes. We plan to employ machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression or a support vector machine, to select a best model that can effectively classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on the available features.
