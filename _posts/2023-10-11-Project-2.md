# Project 2

For this project I wrote queries to pull data from the rapidapi FREE NBA API. Once the data was retrieved, additional manipulation was used through R Studio and the tidyverse packages to create insightful EDA's. Given the nature of the data, NBA stats, I wasn't expecting any eye raising insights but I did find the whole writing a function to query an API very insightful. I previously suspected that API queries would be rather messy, like casting a net in the general direction of data you are looking for and then figuring out the best way to sift through it. After this project, my suspicions were confirmed. This is not necessarily a bad thing. API repositories store vast amounts of data without any specific use in mind and I learned that it is up to the user to have a good idea as to what data they are searching for to help with their research or question. This general research idea will help the user filter through and find the relevant pieces.
