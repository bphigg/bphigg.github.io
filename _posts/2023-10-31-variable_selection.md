# Thoughts on Variable Seletion  

The fact that there are a number of variable selection techniques available to the statistician underscores the general challenge variable selection poses. No one method is more effective or superior than any other method. Each has its own computational theories on which selection is based and each has its own weaknesses.  
Primarily what is at stake is the trade-off between bias and variance. A good variable selection model would have low bias - a number of uncorrelated variables that are used in the prediction model. Deciding what this number should be is the whole idea behind Variable Selection. If the number is too high, say for example all the variables, then bias would be appropriately low (since all the variables are being used to determine the prediction). However, the variance in such a model would be very high since it's most likely that some variables are correlated, negatively affecting the model. Conversely, if the number of variables is too small
