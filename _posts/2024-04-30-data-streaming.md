# Modeling and Predicting with Data Streams (pySpark)

This notebook continues exploring the **MLlib** library in *pySpark* by taking all the modeling concepts from my [Model Fitting Notebook](https://bphigg.github.io/python_data/model_fitting_MLlib.html) and applying it to streaming data (as opposed to a static data file).  The goal was to set up an automated process that takes in live streaming data, transforms the data into the appropriate model format, make predictions based on the model, and append the prediction results to the original data stream. The output for this project was printed to the console, but other output options are also available (csv file, pdf, etc).

Here is the video capturing the resultant output:
