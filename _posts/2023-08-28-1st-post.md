## Data Scientists and Statisticians
 Data Scientists tend to be oriented around utilizing statistical models and programs to problem solve a particular issue or question for an organization or business. A data scientist works in coordination with stakeholders and managers to identify a question or problem that existing data may help solve or add insight to, and therefore needs to be knowledgeable in the business to which the question or problem exists as well as versatile and creative in all manners of data mining, cleaning, and analysis. Lastly, a data scientist will also need to be able to communicate the findings and conclusions to stakeholders in a clear and meaningful way. Statisticians have similar skillsets but tend to be more academic in nature - designing surveys and experiments and interpreting those results.

 I am personally more intrigued by the creative aspects of the programming side and being able to gleam insights from existing data.
