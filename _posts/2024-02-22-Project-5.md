# Data Processing with Simple and Multiple Linear Regression (Python)

[Data Processing with Regression Models Project](https://bphigg.github.io/python_data/Data_Processing_US_Census_Bureau.html)

The first half of this project is the `python` version of [Project 1](https://bphigg.github.io/Project_1/Project_1_v2.html). There I wrote functions to read, transform, and combine data into a format that could be used to create nice visual summaries. Here, we'll read, transform, and combine the same data to be used to fit, train, and test **Simple Linear Regression** and **Multiple Linear Regression** models.

The main take away from this project was to illustrate one way we could go about comparing predictive models. The predicted value, `enrollment`, was not only large but had a lot of variability and the resulting **MSE**'s reflected this. However, we were able to see and measure the difference between the models and understand the differences between the two modeling techniques - which was the main point of the project.
