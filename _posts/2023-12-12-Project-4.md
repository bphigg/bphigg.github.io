**shiny web app** is an interactive web application that allows users to explore large data sets graphically. Building this web application was a lot fun as it pulled together all the data analysis, programming, and presentation skills into one app that presents data to the user in an exciting, interactive way.  I would love to explore more shiny features and learn how to develop more complex apps, especially where the data sets themselves may be dynamic.

For the current app, I think the data set was more limited than it's size led me to believe. Although there were a number of variables included in the data, only two or three turned out to be useful in predicting song popularity. But overall, it was a good set to use in building the app because the number of variables allowed me to learn how robust **shiny apps** are.
