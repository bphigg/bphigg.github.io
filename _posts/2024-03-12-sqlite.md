This is a fairly simple demonstration of **SQL** programming. There are a number of different formats that data can be stored in at Data Warehouses or Data Lakes and knowledge of basic **SQL** programming can be very helpful in retrieving data from any given storgage facility. Additionally, **SQL** code can be used directly in `pysparks` *sparkSQL* library as a way to transform and prep streaming data for analysis or modeling.
