The goal of this project was to read in data from the U.S. Census Bureau and produce customizable charts and graphs summarizing population data. The functions for summarization had to be flexible enough to accomadate the different population types from the census files. For example, some files would be for overall US population while for other file types the population was school enrollment.

There are three main steps outlining this project:

* **Data Processing**: processing and transforming the data from a single data file to the appropriate format that will allow easy plotting and graphing. These processes are then incorporated into functions that are included in an overall *wrapper function* so that one function is able to call one data file and make all the necessary transformations. Finally, a combination function is added that will combine multiple data files into one single file.
* **Summarization**: combining basic data summaries with output plots. These functions allow for basic dynamic input allowing users some control over the output summaries and graphs.
* **Putting It All Together**: the completed project - illustrating the functionality of the data processing functions and graphing functions on two separate types of Census data.
