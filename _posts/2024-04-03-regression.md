This notebook explores some different types of **Regularized Regression** models. **Regularized Regression** models utilize a 'penalty' value to determine the best fit. Essentially, these models perform variable/feature selection, reducing or eliminating the presence of some features depending on the value of the 'penalty'. *LASSO*, *Ridge*, and *ElasticNet* are used in both **Multiple Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression** models and compared to a non-regularized regression model (where variables/features are selected by the user). 5-fold *Cross Validation* was used to select optimal parameters.

Additional information and description of the model types can be found in the notebook.
